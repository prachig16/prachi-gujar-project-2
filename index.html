                    We have got to change our ethics and our financial system and our whole way of understanding the world. It has to be a
                    world in which people live rather than die; a sustainable world. It could be great. I love to design things that people
                    can actually buy. I'm staggered by what a boot costs today. All I did my first year at Vogue was Xerox. I never look at
                    other people's work. My mind has to be completely focused on my own illusions. I sometimes feel that a pattern is almost
                    a fashion statement in itself.

                        Fashion can be this mysterious thing that you can't explain. If you cut a painter's hands off, he'd
                        still feel the urge
                        to pick up a brush. Sometimes the simplest things are the most profound.

                        <p>If you wear clothes that don't suit you, you're a fashion victim. You have to wear clothes that make you look
                            better.
                            Design is a constant challenge to balance comfort with luxe, the practical with the desirable.

                            future.

                    Awkwardness gives me great comfort. I've never been cool, but I've felt cool. I've been in the cool place, but I
                    wasn't
                    really cool - I was trying to pass for hip or cool. It's the awkwardness that's nice. It's sometimes said that
                    I'm
                    rebellious and I do things to push people's buttons, but I just like the challenge. I don't care about money. I
                    really
                    don't care. I just want to do what I do.
