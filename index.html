                    Design is a series of creative choices - it's a collaborative effort, an evolutionary process. You choose
                    your fabrics
                    depending upon what you want to say, then you work with mills to get those fabrics. Through the process, you
                    realize
                    what you want it to be. I wish I had invented blue jeans. They have expression, modesty, sex appeal,
                    simplicity - all I
                    hope for in my clothes.

                        still feel the urge
                        to pick up a brush. Sometimes the simplest things are the most profound.

                        Awkwardness gives me great comfort. I've never been cool, but I've felt cool. I've been in the cool place, but I
                        wasn't
                        really cool - I was trying to pass for hip or cool. It's the awkwardness that's nice. It's sometimes said that
                        I'm
                        rebellious and I do things to push people's buttons, but I just like the challenge. I don't care about money. I
                        really
                        don't care. I just want to do what I do.
